## Overview 


Cover Maker is an easy-to-use tool for making simple eBook covers. Cover Maker is a freelance client project (sharing code here with their permission). Initially, I built this project using React and Bootstrap as per clients requirements, but as I became more fimiliar with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, I thought it would would be a fun experience to migrate this application into Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
